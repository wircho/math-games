            <h2>How to Play</h2>
            <p>The teacher proposes a starting number (for example, 5). Players take turns:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Student's turn:</strong> Add any number from 1 to 9</li>
                <li><strong>Teacher's turn:</strong> Divide by 2 if the number is even, or pass if it's odd</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The student succeeds when they reach or surpass the target number (for example, 100).</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>What to Expect</h2>
            <p>The student might initially add 9 whenever possible to reach the target quickly. However, landing on even numbers allows the teacher to divide and bring the total back down. Through play, students begin to strategize about which numbers to add and when, learning to balance speed with avoiding even numbers.</p>
            <p>Helpful tip: The student can write down numbers and cross off the ones they want to avoid landing on (the even numbers). This visual aid helps them plan their moves more carefully.</p>

            <h2>Examples</h2>

            <div class="example">
                <div class="example-title">Example: Reaching 20 (starting from 5)</div>
                <ul class="steps">
                    <li>Start:            5</li>
                    <li>Student adds 9:  14 (even) — oops!</li>
                    <li>Teacher ÷ 2:      7 (odd)</li>
                    <li>Student adds 9:  16 (even) — oops again!</li>
                    <li>Teacher ÷ 2:      8 (even)</li>
                    <li>Student adds 1:   9 (odd) — staying odd now</li>
                    <li>Teacher passes:   9</li>
                    <li>Student adds 2:  11 (odd)</li>
                    <li>Teacher passes:  11</li>
                    <li>Student adds 2:  13 (odd)</li>
                    <li>Teacher passes:  13</li>
                    <li>Student adds 2:  15 (odd)</li>
                    <li>Teacher passes:  15</li>
                    <li>Student adds 2:  17 (odd)</li>
                    <li>Teacher passes:  17</li>
                    <li>Student adds 2:  19 (odd)</li>
                    <li>Teacher passes:  19</li>
                    <li>Student adds 2:  21 ✓</li>

            <h2>The Math Behind It</h2>
            <div class="concept">
                <p>This game teaches <strong>even and odd numbers</strong>, along with division and strategic thinking.</p>

                <p>The "snakes and ladders" aspect comes from the ups and downs of play: adding numbers moves you toward the goal, while landing on even numbers that get divided brings you back down.</p>

                <p>Through repeated play, students discover that staying on odd numbers prevents the teacher from dividing, allowing steady progress toward the target.</p>

            <h2>Variations</h2>
            <div class="concept">
                <p>Try these variations to explore other mathematical operations:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Divide by 3:</strong> Teacher divides by 3 when the number is divisible by 3, otherwise passes</li>
                    <li><strong>Divide by 5:</strong> Teacher divides by 5 when the number is divisible by 5, otherwise passes</li>
                    <li><strong>Multiple divisors:</strong> Teacher can divide by 2, 3, or 5 (whichever works), choosing strategically</li>
                    <li><strong>Different ranges:</strong> Student can add numbers from 1 to 6, or 1 to 12, changing the game dynamics</li>
                    <li><strong>Higher targets:</strong> Try reaching 200, 500, or even 1000</li>
                    <li><strong><a href="prime-numbers.html">Prime Numbers (Snakes & Ladders Style Game)</a>:</strong> Teacher can divide by any divisor (except 1 or the number itself)</li>
