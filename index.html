            <p>These are games you can play with your kids or students. Each game teaches a specific mathematical concept. Most games are designed for one-on-one play but can be adapted for classroom use. I will post more as I come up with them and test them with my kids.</p>
            <p>These games are not meant to be fair two-player competitions, but rather challenges that teach the student something new or help them review a concept, under the teacher's guidance. They are probably most enjoyable for younger children, but they can be a valuable way for people of all ages to grasp mathematical concepts in a more hands-on way.</p>
            <p>Thanks to Matt DeVos, Sophie Burrill, and Mariolys Rivas for their ideas, motivation, and encouragement to document these games, and to T, C, and S for playing these games with us.</p>
